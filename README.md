### Mod manager for Minecraft Java Edition

Will use Java 21, and will have a hidden snake game, basic LAN chat for 'lan parties', I will try and add discord rp, and it will probably have a nice purpley theme.

Using VS Code, and idk what else atm.

This is just in the idea stage, and I will try and finish this at some point but idk. When I do start, if you want to help, you can I guess. DM me on BlueSky, @TheEverWeird
